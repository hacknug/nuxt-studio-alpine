For the people who know what it is, you may want to check what you are actually using, while for those who are unfamiliar, I would recommend you use this as an opportunity to learn a new tool and acquire the criterion to choose when it may be useful.

Well, Shap values are especially valuable for exploring the contribution of raw features in a model. However, in such fields, we already know a complex feature structure that the models will learn from. For example, in Computer Vision the most granular features are the image pixels (in a single channel, single frame). However, as any Computer Vision community member knows, to be feasible instead of feeding a linear model with the raw pixels, we use (normally) convolutional models over a set of values with a predefined relation among them. This relation is above any insight that Shap values can give since it comes from the nature of our knowledge, and Shap values will intuitively not give any valuable insight from this kind of feature. In the case of CNN's, there are other ways to interpret and explain models, such as filter visualization or more automatic tools (which deserve a specific topic)."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Does that mean (in this case) that Shapley values have no place in Computer Vision?
